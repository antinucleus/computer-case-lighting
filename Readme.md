# COMPUTER CASE LIGHTING

Computer case and monitor lighting project. The electronic control circuit, which has separate lighting inputs for the case and monitor, is controlled by an Arduino Nano and managed via a `C# Forms` desktop application. Using the desktop interface, the case and monitor lighting can be set to different RGB colors separately. The computer fans can be turned on and off, and the lighting can operate in a sound-sensitive manner. Additionally, some special lighting effects can be used.

You can check out `Media` folder for images.
